# Twitter_Sentiment-Analysis_Classical-Approach

Hi Everyone!!

In this project I shall be predicting depression from tweets using classical NLP and Machine Learning Algorithms. The type of data utilised gives great results with simple models and thus there was no need to utilise complex models.

I have added comments in each cell, in order to make understanding much easier for you guys :)
